**ARCHIVED** _I use NixOS now, so this bash script consortium is not needed anymore and most likely never will be again. You can find my NixOS Flake (Config, the equivalent of this) here: https://github.com/ToasterUwU/flake_

# Linux Setup Script

This whole thing is what I made myself to automatically set up my PCs after installing PikaOS.

It adds all Repos for all the Software I use, installs everything I need, and configures every part of the OS just how I like it.

Feel free to fork if you like this and what it does. Just please don't claim it's your work.
Note: If you do fork it, you must edit this to work. I always use "aki" as my username, so I have no reason to do anything besides hardcoding "/home/aki". This is something you will need to change for sure.
