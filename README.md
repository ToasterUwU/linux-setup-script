# Linux Setup Script

To see the actual code and assets, switch to the branch of the DE you want to see the setup for.

This whole thing is what i made myself to automatically setup my PCs after installing PikaOS.

It adds all Repos for all the Software i use, it installs everything i need, it configures every part of the OS just the way i like it.

If you like this and like what it does, feel free to fork it. Just please dont claim its your work.
